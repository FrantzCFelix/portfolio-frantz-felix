My Portfolio- Bio is on my main page. On my portfolio page, I ran into an issue that made me use z-index which is bad practice. I will revisit to see what I did wrong. I also had issues with the contact page, borders disapearing and having to 'hard code' elements to line up which may lead to problems on screens of different sizes.
